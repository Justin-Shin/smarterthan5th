##Technologies Used##
The technologies used in this project were HTML, CSS, and Javascript. All testing was done on Google Chrome.

##Approach Taken##
The approach taken for this project, was to start with a basic trivia quiz that was shown on the web page and then the user would have to click a button to move onto the next question. After I got the basic layout I went on from there to make the use ability better I ended up removing the buttons entirely so that way the user couldn't keep on clicking until they got the right answer.

##Installation Instructions##
####Required Software####
Google Chrome

##Downloading##
User can download zip file from repository, and then unzip and run the index.html from within the unzipped folder to play the game locally on there web browser otherwise it is accessible online.

##Unsolved Problems##
Needs different alerts when user gets answer right or wrong then the browser default alerts.

Needs a timeout feature that would mark the answer wrong if user doesn't answer within 30 seconds.

End game response based on user score.
